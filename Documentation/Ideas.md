Ability to join/connect multiple folders.


.md = markdown, metadata - data about data.

Scan for incorrect documentation: incorrect folders.

More than 3 depth folders might be frustrating to navigate the project.

Each .md readme should contain a tree map with current position highlighted, ability to move to other places around Operating System.

Treat special words like "Operating System" as "Operating_System": automatically making into a link.


Idea for commands:  
`File new "./textfile.txt"`  
`File new textFile "./file"`  
 

Folders should be created according to the target to be achieved:  
**Example:** Working on printing folder structure:   
* Operating_System/System/Print_Folder_Structure/Algorithms  
* Operating_System/System/Print_Folder_Structure/Research  
* Operating_System/System/Print_Folder_Structure/Implementation
  
The folder structure starts with the `Print_Folder_Structure` as target of the project.
