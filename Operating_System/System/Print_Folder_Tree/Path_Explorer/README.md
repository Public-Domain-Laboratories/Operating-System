Search Graph Search Algorithm Terminology mapping onto file structure terms:  
Root Node = Zero level folder.  
Node = subfolder.  
Branch = subfolder structure

Backtracking - Stack data structure needed.  
Usually a stack, is needed to keep track of the nodes discovered so far along a specified branch which helps in backtracking of the graph.
