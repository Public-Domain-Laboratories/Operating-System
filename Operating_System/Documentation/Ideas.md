Ability to join/connect multiple folders.


.md = markdown, metadata - data about data.

Scan for incorrect documentation: incorrect folders.

More than 3 depth folders might be frustrating to navigate the project.

Each .md readme should contain a tree map with current position highlighted, ability to move to other places around Operating System.

Treat special words like "Operating System" as "Operating_System": automatically making into a link.
